## Overview

`project-create-a-comprehensive` is a comprehensive government permit management system designed to streamline the permit application process for citizens and businesses while providing government agencies with efficient tools for review, approval, and reporting.  This application allows for online permit applications, secure document uploads, real-time status tracking, automated notifications, secure payment processing, and robust reporting capabilities, all while adhering to public records laws and government transparency requirements.

## Features

**User-Facing Functionality:**

* **Online Permit Application:** Submit permit applications with integrated document upload functionality.
* **Real-time Status Tracking:** Monitor application progress and receive automated notifications.
* **Secure Payment Integration:** Process permit fees securely through integrated payment gateway (implementation details TBD).
* **Permit Renewal Management:** Manage permit renewals and receive automated reminders.
* **Public Access to Information:** View permit statuses and inspection records publicly.

**Government Agency Functionality:**

* **Streamlined Review Workflows:** Manage and route applications through multi-departmental review processes.

* **Secure User Management & Access Control:**  Granular control over user permissions and access levels.


**Technical Highlights:**

* Robust and scalable backend using FastAPI.
* User-friendly frontend built with React and TypeScript.
* Secure data management with SQLite (scalable database solution to be determined based on future needs).
* Containerized for easy deployment and portability using Docker.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM) -  *Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL for production deployments.*
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Testing**:  *(Specify testing framework, e.g., pytest)*


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* Docker (optional, but recommended for deployment)
* A text editor or IDE


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
